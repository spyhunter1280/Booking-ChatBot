Problem Statement
1. Tourists have to spend a lot of time searching for an appropriate flight, hotel or restaurant.
2. They  face problems due to scattered data on websites and unable to find user-friendly interfaces.
3. Being in a foreign land, they feel helpless in case  of emergency or a panic situation. 
4. Their travel experience becomes miserable if they don't have anyone to guide them like a friend.
5. There's no assistant to deal with tourists' problems such as medical emergency, currency exchange, etc

Solution We Provide
1. The idea is to develop a travel buddy for the people to make them fall in love with the beauty of Rajasthan.
2. The travel bot interacts with the users and help them visit the tourist spots of Rajasthan. The bot can tell them the nearby tourist places according to their current location.
3. The bot will jump to the travel booking websites to help the user book for hotels and restaurants .
4. The bot  will be able to interact with the user about most liked foods and restaurants of Rajasthan. Also, it can encourage them to buy  the Handicrafts and souvenirs (such as from Rajasthali).
5. It will suggest the events( cultural or others) happening in the city and provide information about  entry passes.
6. The bot will be able to provide directions to go to a place by fetching data from Google maps API.	( Recently, a tourist couple had medical problem while roaming around and they couldnâ€™t find a hospital) it will be able to give the contact information of nearby  police and hospital authorities.
